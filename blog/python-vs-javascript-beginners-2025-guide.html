            <!-- TL;DR -->
            <section>
                <h2>TL;DR</h2>
                <p>
                    Both Python and JavaScript are excellent first languages in 2025. Choose <strong>Python</strong> if
                    you want the easiest entry, strong AI/data opportunities, and readable syntax. Choose
                    <strong>JavaScript</strong> if you want to build interactive web apps fast, enter the front-end
                    ecosystem, or aim for full-stack roles. This guide breaks the choice down by jobs, projects,
                    learning speed, AI tools, and a 30-day starter plan you can follow today.
                    
                </p>
            </section>

            <!-- Intro -->
            <section>
                <p>
                    In 2025 the question "Python or JavaScript first?" keeps popping up on forums, bootcamp
                    course pages, and Discord servers. Both languages top popularity charts and job listings, but
                    they serve different strengths. This isn't about picking a winner forever — it's about picking the
                    best first step for your goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below you'll get a clear, honest comparison, plus a short 30-day plan that pairs with the
                    <em>Beginner’s Roadmap to Software Engineering</em> — so you can start building and avoid
                    "vibe coding" traps.

            <!-- Quick comparison table (text) -->
            <section>
                <h2>Quick Comparison</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Learning curve:</strong> Python is slightly gentler for absolute beginners.</li>
                    <li><strong>Where it shines:</strong> Python → AI, data, prototyping. JavaScript → web,
                        interactivity,
                        front-end and full-stack.</li>
                    <li><strong>Jobs & demand:</strong> Both very strong in 2025; Python leads in AI/data roles while JS
                        dominates web roles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Community & learning resources:</strong> Massive for both — choose where you’ll finish
                        projects.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <!-- Why both still matter -->
            <section>
                <h2>Why both still matter in 2025</h2>
                <p>
                    The programming landscape changed a lot with AI coding tools — they speed up scaffolding and
                    reduce boilerplate — but they didn't make languages irrelevant. Companies still hire for domain
                    knowledge (web engineering vs data engineering), and languages are gateways to those domains.
                    In other words: AI helps you move faster, but the language you choose steers the kinds of jobs and
                    projects you'll build.
                </p>
            </section>

            <!-- Deep dive: Python -->
            <section>
                <h2>Python — Why beginners love it (and why it still rules)</h2>
                <p>
                    Python's syntax is clean and expressive, which makes it easy to read and write. That lowers
                    friction for the first projects — scripts, small games, or data exercises. The language also
                    benefits from a huge ecosystem (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch) that powers AI and data
                    science jobs in 2025. If your curiosity points toward automation, AI, or research-oriented roles,
                    Python is a smart first pick.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Practical wins: build a text-based game, an automation script, or a simple data visualization in a
                    weekend. That immediate reward is what turns beginners into builders.
                </p>
            </section>

            <!-- Deep dive: JavaScript -->
            <section>
                <h2>JavaScript — Why it’s still the web’s language (and a beginner favourite)</h2>
                <p>
                    JavaScript runs in every browser, so you get instant visual feedback as you learn. Want to create
                    interactive buttons, animations, or a to-do app and share it with friends? JS gets you there
                    quickly. In 2025 the front-end ecosystem (React, Vue, Svelte) + TypeScript remains the primary
                    path to web development and many full-stack roles. If you prefer visual, interactive projects,
                    JavaScript will keep you excited.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Practical wins: build a personal site, a small React app, or a live UI feature in days — perfect for
                    portfolio-building.
                </p>
            </section>

            <!-- AI & security considerations -->
            <section>
                <h2>AI tools: a help — but watch for security and over-reliance</h2>
                <p>
                    AI coding assistants (Copilot, Google’s agents, etc.) speed up prototyping and can explain code —
                    great for beginners. However, studies show a large share of AI-generated code contains security
                    flaws, so learning fundamentals and safe practices remains crucial. Use AI to accelerate, not
                    replace, your learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tip: always read and test AI-suggested code. Ask the model to explain lines and identify edge
                    cases. That practice turns AI into a teacher rather than a crutch.
                </p>
            </section>

            <!-- Career & salary outlook -->
            <section>
                <h2>Jobs & salary — what the market wants in 2025</h2>
                <p>
                    Both languages appear on recruiters’ most-wanted lists. Python leads in AI/data engineering roles,
                    while JavaScript (and TypeScript) are staples for front-end and full-stack jobs. Salaries depend
                    more
                    on role and experience than language — AI and data roles often pay a premium, which tends to
                    favor Python specialists. That said, strong full-stack JavaScript devs remain highly paid and in
                    demand.

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Want visual, interactive projects fast?</strong> → Start with JavaScript.</li>
                    <li><strong>Curious about AI, data, automation?</strong> → Start with Python.</li>

            <!-- 30-day starter plan -->
            <section>
                <h2>30-Day Starter Plan (Pick one: Python or JS)</h2>
                <p>
                    Follow this plan with your chosen language — the goal is finishable projects, not perfection.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Setup (VS Code, Git), Hello World, basic syntax, variables, control
                        flow.
                        (Use small exercises from the Beginner’s Roadmap.) </li>
                    <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> Build your first tiny project (to-do list for JS; number guesser or
                        quiz for
                        Python).</li>
                    <li><strong>Week 3:</strong> Add features: persistence (localStorage or simple file/JSON), input
                        validation,
                        basic styling or text formatting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Week 4:</strong> Polish & publish: deploy your site or share your script on GitHub;
                        write a short
                        README explaining what you built.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Ship something in 30 days — imperfect, but real. Use AI for scaffolding and learning explanations,
                    but
                    write and test the code yourself.

                <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do I have to pick only one forever?<br>
                    <strong>A:</strong> No. Most devs learn multiple languages over time. Your first pick is just the
                    fastest
                    way to build confidence.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Q:</strong> Will AI make learning a language pointless?<br>
                    <strong>A:</strong> No. AI helps, but understanding fundamentals helps you spot errors, design
                    better
                    systems, and build secure, maintainable code.

                <p>
                    There's no single "right" first language — only the right first project. Pick the language that
                    helps
                    you finish something this month. Finish one tiny project, learn from it, then pick the next one.
                    Consistency beats perfection.
